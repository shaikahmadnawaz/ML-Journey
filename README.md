# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning journey repository! This repository serves as a record of my progress and learning experiences as I explore the fascinating world of machine learning.

## About Me

I'm Nawaz, a passionate learner with a keen interest in machine learning and data science. Through this repository, I aim to document my journey, share knowledge, and connect with fellow learners and experts in the field.

## Learning Path

I will be organizing my learning journey into various topics, such as:

- **Topic 1:** Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Topic 2:** Linear Regression
- **Topic 3:** Neural Networks
- **Topic 4:** Data Preprocessing
- ...and more to come!

Each topic will have its own dedicated directory within this repository, containing detailed notes, code samples, and any projects I work on related to that topic.

## How to Navigate

Feel free to explore the repository, dive into the topics that interest you, and provide feedback or ask questions through issues and discussions. I'm open to collaboration and learning together with the community.
